# Students performance classification
This is a project to study the use of some supervised ML algorithms to classify and study students performance in exams
The project was developed in Kaggle and shared to GitHub. 

# Data
* The data used in this project here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams. 
* The original data contained three attributes forming three diffrent exams score for each student. The exams were averaged and transformed into two categories above and equal to 65 and less than 65. The tranformation is necessary to convert the problem into classification one. 
Note: The data can also be studied in different ways such as using supervised regression models. 

# ML Algorithms
The project used some well known supervised algorithms provided by scikit-learn such as Logestic Regression, Support Verctor Machine and Random Forest.
